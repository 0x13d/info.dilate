**PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated: 2025-08-24

Dilate, Inc. ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application, Dilate (the "App").

**1. NO DATA COLLECTION**

We do not collect, store, or track any personal information or user data through the App. Your privacy is paramount, and the App is designed to function without the need to access your personal data.

**2. CAMERA ACCESS**

The App requires access to your device's camera. This access is essential for the core functionality of the App, which is to guide you through various eye exercises by visually tracking your eye movements in real-time.

**How We Use the Camera:**

*   The camera is used solely to enable the eye exercise features within the App.
*   The App analyzes the camera feed locally on your device to provide feedback during the exercises.
*   We do not store, record, or transmit any images, video, or data from your camera. All processing occurs on your device and is discarded immediately after the session ends.

**3. CONSENT**

By using the App, you consent to the use of your camera as described in this policy. The App will request your permission to access the camera when you first use the feature. You can revoke this permission at any time through your device's settings, but doing so will disable the eye exercise functionality of the App.

**4. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

**5. CONTACT US**

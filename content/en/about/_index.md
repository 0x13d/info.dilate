**DISCLAIMER:**

Dilate is an experimental and just for fun app designed to help you with eye exercises.

### What is Dilate?

Dilate uses an innovative machine learning approach to help you with eye exercises. The below exercises can be combined with Dilate by looking through the augmented reality filter and focusing on high contrast text such as posters and signs.

#### Eye Movement Exercises:

##### Convergence:

Hold a pencil or pen about 10 inches from your face and focus on its tip. Slowly move the pencil closer to your nose until it becomes blurry. Repeat 10-15 times. 

##### Divergence:

Extend your arms straight out in front of you and focus on a fingertip about 10 feet away. Slowly move your arms apart, keeping your focus on the fingertip until it becomes blurry. Repeat 10-15 times. 

##### Vertical Eye Movements:

Look up as high as you can, then down as low as you can. Repeat 10-15 times. 

##### Horizontal Eye Movements:

Look to the left as far as you can, then to the right. Repeat 10-15 times. 

#### Advanced Exercises: 
 
##### Figure-Eight Exercise:

Trace an imaginary figure-eight in the air with your eyes, looking up, down, left, and right. Repeat 10-15 times. 

##### Wheel Exercise:

Imagine a wheel spinning in front of you. Follow the spokes with your eyes as they move around the circle. Repeat 10-15 times. 

### Anything else?

The app is free to use for two minutes at a time. After that a soft paywall appears that requires the app to be restarted for another free two minutes.

If you would like to support the app you may pay for the $1.99/year subscription. This helps develop and maintain the app but is not required. In the future there may be advanced features that require a subscription to access.
